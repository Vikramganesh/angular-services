Service is a piece of code that are used to perform a specific task.
It is a mechanism used to share the functionality between components.
--> service can contain a value,function or both.
--> services are injected into application using dependenacy injection machanism.
--> services prevent us from writting the same code at multiple sections of our appilication.
--> the best solution is write single reusable service and  inject it into the component that need it.

what is dependancy injection ?

It is HEART of the Angular Application.

Here dependancy is an object that supplies the dependancies to the other object.

Injection is a process of passing  the dependancy to a dependant object.
 



Creating Services in angular
=============================
Step-1: Create a service using following command
	ng g s test-service

Step-2: Add that service in app.module.ts at providers array.
	providers:[]

Step-3: Now use that service in component.

	constractor(private ser:service){
	}
	this.ser.<methods that are provided by service>

In the context of creating modules we can import that 
service in app.module.ts file so that service are available to 
all components of that module, and also if we need to create a new 
module,add that module into root level module called app.module.ts file
So that service also available for that module and all components of 
that new created module.

Using created service	
=======================

Step-1: Import HttpClientModule in app.module.ts file.

Step-2: Import HttpClient in component.ts file.

Step-3: Create Instance for HttpClient in component Constractor.
